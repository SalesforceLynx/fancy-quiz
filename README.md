# fancy-quiz
A Simple Vue Quiz App. 

This app is started as the practice for the tutorial by Gwendolyn Faraday. You can follow her on twitter here https://twitter.com/gwen_faraday 

I decided to add some enhancements that was missed in the very first tutorial. Few checks here & there just to make it little bit more fancy. Gwen did a great job in explaining the stuff but I'm someone who needs some more details and attention to understand the topic. So following the tutorial wasn't enough. So that I decided to add some features to understand the concepts in a better way.

# Demo 1 Quiz
If you want to see what my version of original code was doing. You can follow the link https://pure-beyond-10179.herokuapp.com/ which I set up on heroku.

# Demo 2 Fancy-Quiz
There's another heroku app that I set up on heroku which have slightly more features in it. For my practice and learning.

1. Added a previous button to go back to the previous question.
2. Also added a check for letting the user know the start and end of questions by disabling the next & previous buttons.
3. Once the user will submit the answer it will not be open anymore for another attempt. Also submit button marked as submitted.
4. Some changes in the header section to give more information to the user about the quiz like Score, Attempted, Correct, Incorrect & Total questions.
